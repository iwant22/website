            Hello, I am a first generation Mexican-American Computer Sciences student at CSUF.
            Currently I am in my Junior year in the program but I consider my self a freshman 
            since this is my first year at CSUF. I transfered from Santa Ana College to CSUF 
            in the Fall of 2025. I graduated from Santa Ana College with my Associate of Science 
            in Computer Science and I plan to obtain my Bachlors degeer in Computer Science.
            I plan to achive this in the Spring of 2026 but that could change. After college 
            I hope to obtain a job in the tech field either as a software engineer or with a 
            postion in IT. I hope this website helps you get to know me a little bit better!
